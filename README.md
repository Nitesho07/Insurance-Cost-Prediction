# 🩺 Insurance Cost Analysis: An Initial Exploration

## 📝 Overview

This project serves as an initial exploratory analysis into the factors influencing medical insurance costs. The primary goal is to perform essential machine learning tasks such as data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data preprocessing to prepare the dataset for future modeling.

The work documented in the Jupyter Notebook represents the foundational steps of building a predictive model.

## 🚧 Project Status

**Work in Progress.**

This repository currently contains the initial phase of the project, which includes:
* A thorough exploratory analysis of the dataset.
* Data cleaning and preprocessing pipelines.
* A baseline model to establish initial performance metrics.

## 📁 Dataset

The project uses the `insurance.csv` dataset, which contains personal attributes and medical costs billed by a health insurance provider.

---
## ✅ Tasks Completed

1.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** The dataset was loaded, inspected, and visualized to understand the distributions of different variables and identify potential relationships between them.
2.  **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Categorical features (`sex`, `smoker`, `region`) were converted into a numerical format to prepare the data for machine learning algorithms.
